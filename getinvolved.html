<h1>GET INVOLVED</h1>
<P>Do you have a bright idea on how to use bioluminescence to improve your world? From illuminated candy to brightening your streets and conserving electricity, to military uses and cancer-treating drugs, bioluminescence is being used many ways today to improve upon our future.<br><br>Want to try out using bioluminescence at home? Check out this cool dino pet that glows at night...all based on science. What is your bright idea? Click on the CLEE image below to tell us about your idea and receive a free gift. </P>

  <H2>DO IT YOURSELF</H2><P>The Dino Pet is a living, interactive “pet” that uses naturally occurring bioluminescence to glow brilliantly when you play with it at night. The glow comes from microscopic sea life called Dinoflagellates The Dino Pet is powered by sunlight, water and simple nutrients. No batteries or charging is required.

  <h2>THE EXHIBIT</h2>
  <P>Visitors to Glow: Living Lights start their journey by investigating the chemical process that produces “cool” light. They then explore the world of light-producing terrestrial organisms like fireflies, glow worms and foxfire fungus before traveling on to the mid-ocean, where an estimated 90 percent of the animals produce light. Here visitors encounter alien-looking creatures like viper fish and cookie cutter sharks. Visitors continue on to demonstrations of the interesting techniques and equipment used by scientists to study bioluminescence, and then explore the many benefits of this research — from helping to speed the study of cancer-fighting drugs to the detection of anthrax spores in public places.</P>
